**Another purchaing servers problem for AMZ full-time - [**Purchase Servers**](https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-purchase-servers)**

Given a list of `n` servers, with the computing power of ith server at `powers[i]`. A client wants to buy some `K` servers out of these `n` servers. The condition is that when these `K` servers are rearranged, the absolute difference between the computing powers of two adjacent servers should be less then or equal to 1. Also, these servers will form a circular network. So the first and last servers will also be considered adjacent. Find the maximum number of servers `K`, which the client can buy.

### **Example**

#### **Input**

powers = [4, 3, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1]

#### **Output**

5
