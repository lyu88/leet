# Problem

Amazon is creating a system which always returns perfect strings. A perfect string is a string in which no 2 adjacent characters are same. You will be given a starting string which can be perfect or cannot be. You have to return the lexicographically next smallest perfect string greater than the current string lexicographically.

### **Example**

#### **Input**

s = "abzzzcd"

#### **Output**

"acababa"
